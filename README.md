# 🏫 NYC High School SAT Performance Analysis

This project explores and analyzes SAT performance across New York City public high schools. Using a dataset containing average scores in Math, Critical Reading, and Writing, we extract meaningful insights and identify trends in student performance across boroughs.

## 📊 Objective
To identify:
- Top-performing schools in Math
- Boroughs with highest and lowest overall SAT scores
- Patterns or disparities in SAT performance
- Statistical summaries (mean, std deviation) of SAT scores by borough

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes the following key fields:
- `school_name`: Name of the school  
- `borough`: NYC borough where the school is located  
- `average_math`, `average_reading`, `average_writing`: Average SAT scores  
- `total_SAT`: Combined SAT score (Math + Reading + Writing)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Jupyter Notebook / DataCamp Workspace**

## 📈 Key Analyses
- Filtered schools with average math scores ≥ 640
- Grouped and summarized SAT performance by borough
- Calculated standard deviation to find boroughs with most performance variation
- Created visualizations (bar charts, histograms) for score distributions

## ✅ Sample Insights
- Some boroughs had significantly higher SAT performance consistency
- A few schools stood out with exceptional math performance
- Math scores tend to show more variance than reading or writing

## 🤝 Acknowledgments
- Dataset provided by DataCamp
- Project built as part of a DataCamp practice exercise
